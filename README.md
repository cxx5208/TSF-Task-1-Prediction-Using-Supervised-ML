**Project Title:** Predicting Student Exam Scores with Supervised Machine Learning

**Objective:** Develop a predictive model to estimate students' exam scores based on the number of hours they studied.

**Approach:** Utilize supervised machine learning techniques, such as linear regression or decision trees, to build a predictive model. Train the model on a dataset containing students' study hours and corresponding exam scores.

**Outcome:** Provide a reliable tool for educators and students to predict exam performance, helping students optimize their study time and improve their academic outcomes.
